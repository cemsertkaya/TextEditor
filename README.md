# Project Summary 
In this project, we did a basic implementation of a text editor(Notepad) with Java Programming Language. 
## You can basically do following actions:
- Opening a file with directory. 
- Closing a file. • Creating a file. 
- Saving a file. 
- Finding a word and changing it with the given word.
- Correcting single transpositions.
##### Single transpositions: Single transpositions of “cem” word are “ecm”,”cme”,”mec”.
The text must be in English and it can be separated with punctuation marks. If the txt file contains the word then it's accepted directly. If the word cannot be found in the txt file then we check the single_transpositons list, if this list contains the word then the word is corrected the equivalent word from the words txt file (Ex: aaili is corrected to aalii ) on the other hand if both of the lists does not contain the word then nothing would executed to the word.
