Sometimes we find the remains of plants and animals which lived millions of years ago and have since turned to stone. These remains are called fossils. When the animal died, long, long ago, by drowning, for instance, its body sank to the bottom of the water and gradually layers of sand or silt were deposited over it. Over a period of thousands of years, the silt turned to stone and so did the remains of the animal which were preserved in it.  petrified. These ancient-tree-trunks are now coal. Among the coal that is found in coal-mines, there are often numerous animal fossils as well.aoclytes,acromeagly. Batrhobes PRYAMIDS

Many parts of our body go into the making of the sounds which we utter and the words which we say to one another. Speech starts when the diaphram squeezes air out of our lungs and into the windpipe. At the top end of the windpipe is the larynx, or ‘Adam’s apple’-that is the hard bit you can feel at the front of your neck. Inside the larynx are the vocal cords, two bands of elastic tissue like a strings of a violin. As the air passes over these cords, they vibrate to produce sound.
Sound is turned into words when it reaches the mouth, by movments of the tongue and lips
